1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

Ans:Product and product category has a relationship because of common id.
Product table has category_id which is foriegnkey. Product_Category table has "id" key that is Primary key.
Therefore, each product will belong to certain category whose relation can be known by this "category_id" in the product table.

Ex:In category "Electronics",I can have mobile phone as product.

2.How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Ans:In SQL:

     We can use "foreign key constraint":

     The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.

     Here,we can set up foriegn key constraint on categoryid column in Product table, referencing the primary key "id" of Product_category.

     ALTER TABLE product
     ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
     FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
     REFERENCES product_category(id);

     In MongoDB:

     Here while we save product, we can ensure whether that category exists or not

     Ex:Suppose we have "Products" schema which has category_id key and one "Productcategories" schema:

       const product = new Product({
        ...req.body,
        category_id

        });
        const existingCategory = await Product_Category.findById(category_id);
        if (!existingCategory) {
        throw new Error('Invalid category ID');
        }

        await product.save();
